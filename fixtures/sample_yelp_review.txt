So disappointed.
the food really. I got the pork belly "carbonara" and not only was the pork belly the worst I've ever had (a was cold and undercooked), but the rice cakes were even . And maybe it was the yolk that made the rice cakes taste bad but something was off and literally had to gulp down my food with the wine. I was so disappointed; I haven't had such a bad man in such a long time. I had a decision to make at that time, say something or not. And despite being a $28 meal that I absolutely hated, I chickened out and paid the full amount. I know probably the wrong decision but I just couldn't bring myself to have them take it back because I'd feel terrible. I hate doing that. So probably the wrong decision but here we are.

On the other hand, the service was absolutely fantastic! Everyone was so nice. I greatly appreciated that!
To drink I had the cab. Tasty and lighter than most cabs.

I'd probably come back for the wine/drinks. The food? I don't think so
